This will be done using the Dynamical Imaging of Coherent Sources (DICS) approach (Gross et al, 2001). This is a beamforming methodology based on spatial filtering operating in the frequency domain. For each grid point in the brain, a spatial filter is derived based on the forward model and the cross-spectral density (CSD) matrix. A multitaper approach is applied for the spectral estimates.\n","The approach allows for estimating the power modulations at each grid points which then is mapped onto the indiviual structural MRIs.

The filters are regularized corresponding to loading the diagonal of the covariance matrix with 5% of the sensor power. For each source the orientation is optimized to maximize the power of the output. Defining *noise_csd* serves to perform spatial prewhitening of the data (Sekihara et al. 2008, Engemann and Gramfort 2015, Westner et al. 2021). We here do this using data from the pre-stimulus interval; however, empty room data could be used as well. As a result the magnetometer and gradiometer signals are uncorrelated to each other but have the same variance. Since the whitening is done separately for the magnetometers and gradiometers, the scale difference between the scale disappears allowing for the data from the two sensor types to be combined. The compensentation for depth bias is set `depth = 0` as condition or intervals will be compared. The relative comparisons alleviate depth bias. The `mean` in `csd_common.mean()` serves to average the CSDs over frequencies. Given that the covariance (or CSD) are severely rank-deficient due to the application of SSS and ICA, MNE-Python automatically computes a truncated pseudo-inverse using the rank calculated above. For the data ($X$) with rank $k$ the truncated pseudo-inverse ($X^\\dagger$) is calculated using singular value decomposition $ X = U \\Sigma V^T$ ; $X^\\dagger = V \\Sigma^{-1}_k U^T$\n","where we consider the first $k$ diagonal values of $\\Sigma$ as well as the first $k$ columns of $U$ and $V$.  This allows that the DISC algorithm is effectively applied in a virtual channel space of size `rank` (= 69 in this case) and no further regularization is required (`reg = 0`)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":30,"metadata":{"id":"tkFihoG96p6o","outputId":"9391496e-e22b-4490-cafc-478dc4b51e92","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721941316608,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":718,"user":{"displayName":"Mark Forbush","userId":"13883367949449200384"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Identifying common channels ...\n","Identifying common channels ...\n","Computing inverse operator with 306 channels.\n","    306 out of 306 channels remain after picking\n","Selected 306 channels\n","Whitening the forward solution.\n","Computing rank from covariance with rank={'meg': 68}\n","    Setting small MEG eigenvalues to zero (without PCA)\n","Creating the source covariance matrix\n","Adjusting source covariance matrix.\n","Computing rank from covariance with rank={'meg': 68}\n","Computing rank from covariance with rank={'meg': 68}\n","Computing DICS spatial filters...\n","Computing beamformer filters for 516 sources\n","Filter computation complete\n"]}],"source":["afilters = make_dics(epochs.info, fwd, csd_acommon.mean() , noise_csd=csd_anoise.mean(),\n","                    reg=0, pick_ori='max-power', reduce_rank=True, real_filter=True, rank=rank, depth = 0)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":31,"metadata":{"id":"lC3mp4ys6p6o","outputId":"7d55bba4-3af5-4041-fdd7-0ed4c0c80265","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721941316608,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":24,"user":{"displayName":"Mark Forbush","userId":"13883367949449200384"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Computing DICS source power...\n","[done]\n","Computing DICS source power...\n","[done]\n","Computing DICS source power...\n","[done]\n","Computing DICS source power...\n","[done]\n"]}],"source":["stc_aleft_cue, freqs = apply_dics_csd(csd_aleft_cue.mean(), afilters)\n","stc_aleft_act, freqs  = apply_dics_csd(csd_aleft_act.mean(), afilters)\n","stc_aright_cue, freqs = apply_dics_csd(csd_aright_cue.mean(), afilters)\n","stc_aright_act, freqs  = apply_dics_csd(csd_aright_act.mean(), afilters)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hwJkb2BE6p6o"},"source":["Calculate the relative change in power; i.e. the change in alpha power comparing the interval before and after the moving grating onset.

To localize the modulation in the alpha band, the cross-spectral density (CSD) was calculated for the 8 to 12 Hz band using a multi-taper approach applying 2 Hz spectral smoothing. The CSD matrix was then calculated for the 300 - 800 ms stimulus interval in which the gratings were shown as well as the -800 – -300 ms pre-stimulus interval (using one DPSS taper). The combined CSD was used with the forward model to create a common spatial filter. This was done by first estimating the rank of the data (being reduced to ~70 due to the SSS and ICA approaches). The data were spatially pre-whitened using the covariance matrix from the baseline interval which allowed for combining the gradiometer and magnetometer data in the source modelling. The truncated pseudo-inverse was then calculated based on the estimated rank (Jas et al., 2018). For each source, the orientation was optimized to maximize the power of the output. The spatial filter was then applied to the CSDs to calculate the relative change in alpha power. As similar approach was used for the gamma band now considering the 60 - 90 Hz band and 8 Hz spectral smoothing (resulting in 3 DPSS tapers). The pre-stimulus time-interval was -0.6 to -0.125 s and the post-stimulus interval was 0.125 to 0.6 s. The source data were then mapped to the structural MRI. \""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"9v0KgolB6p6v"},"source":["## References\n","\n","* Gross J, Kujala J, Hamalainen M, Timmermann L, Schnitzler A, Salmelin R.
